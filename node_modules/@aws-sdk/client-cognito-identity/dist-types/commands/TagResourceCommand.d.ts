/**
 * <p>Assigns a set of tags to the specified Amazon Cognito identity pool. A tag is a label
 *          that you can use to categorize and manage identity pools in different ways, such as by
 *          purpose, owner, environment, or other criteria.</p>
 *          <p>Each tag consists of a key and value, both of which you define. A key is a general
 *          category for more specific values. For example, if you have two versions of an identity
 *          pool, one for testing and another for production, you might assign an
 *             <code>Environment</code> tag key to both identity pools. The value of this key might be
 *             <code>Test</code> for one identity pool and <code>Production</code> for the
 *          other.</p>
 *          <p>Tags are useful for cost tracking and access control. You can activate your tags so that
 *          they appear on the Billing and Cost Management console, where you can track the costs
